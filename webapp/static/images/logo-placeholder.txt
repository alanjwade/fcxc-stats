To add your Fort Collins High School logo:

1. Save your logo image as 'logo.png' in this directory: /home/alan/Documents/code/fcxc_stats/webapp/static/images/
2. The logo should be approximately 40px tall for best display in the navigation bar
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
4. The logo will automatically appear in the navigation bar once the file is added

The website will check for the logo and show it if available, otherwise it will show just the text and running icon.
