#
# bump_release.sh — create the next release tag for this app (target-agnostic).
#
# This script is the ONLY thing you run to ship a release. It knows nothing
# about where the app is deployed: it does NOT touch any compose file, host,
# or version file. The deployed tag is owned by homelab-infra (scripts/update-apps.sh).
#
# What it does on an otherwise clean git tree:
#   1. sanity-checks that the working tree is clean
#   2. reads the newest existing `vX.Y.Z` tag as the base version
#   3. computes the next version (patch by default; minor/major accepted)
#   4. pushes the current branch to origin (so the tag points at a pushed commit)
#   5. creates + pushes the new annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag
#
# Pushing the tag is what triggers CI to build & publish the Docker image; the
# image is built with APP_VERSION=<this tag>, which the webapp shows in its
# footer. No tracked file changes here — the release stays a clean operation.
#
# Usage:
#   ./bump_release.sh          # v1.0.7 -> v1.0.8
#   ./bump_release.sh minor     # v1.0.7 -> v1.1.0
#   ./bump_release.sh major     # v1.0.7 -> v2.0.0
#
# Requirements: run from inside this git repo; git on PATH.
